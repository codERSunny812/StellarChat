# ‚õèÔ∏èProcess

1. ### Planning and Setup

   The development process began with thorough planning to outline the project's requirements, features, and technologies to be used.
2. ### Backend Development

   We built the backend using Express.js to create RESTful APIs for user authentication, message handling, and video call functionality.
3. ### Frontend Development

   With the backend in place, we focused on front-end development using React. We designed and implemented the user interface, leveraging React hooks and state management libraries for efficiency.
4. ### Testing and Debugging

   Thorough testing was conducted to identify and address any bugs or issues. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests were performed to ensure reliability.
5. ### Deployment and Optimization

   The application was deployed to a hosting platform, with optimization for performance, scalability, and security. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines were set up for smooth updates.
6. ### Monitoring and Maintenance

   Monitoring tools were implemented to track the application's performance, uptime, and user activity. Regular maintenance and updates were performed to address security vulnerabilities and enhance user experience.
